IF-C01COMG Full BNC Clone board SMD

This is a full sized version of the IF-C01COMG board for JVC pro monitors (TM-Hxx50CG) and some others...

It is created as a very close to 1:1 copy of the original (sans the stereo-to-mono mixing circuit and internal 75R term option)
thus it has dual stack BNCs, which are pretty expensive, to allow for passthrough of video signals.

Board is for now completely untested...
